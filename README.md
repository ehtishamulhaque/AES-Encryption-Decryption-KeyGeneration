# Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Cipher

Above is the C++ implementation of the AES cipher, including an Encryptor, Decryptor, and Key Generator.

 1. Round key for Round#1
 2. Round key for Round#2
 3. Output of 1st round of Encryptor.
 4. Output of 2nd round of Encryptor.
 5. Output of 1st  round of Decryptor.
 6. Output of 2nd round of Decryptor.

# Practical
The practical implementation can be viewed in the PDF file.
